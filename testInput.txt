If you compile and execute Program 16.2, redirecting the input to a file with a com- mand such ascopyprog < infilethe program displays the contents of the file infile at the terminal.Try it and see! Actually, the program serves the same basic function as the cat command under Unix, and you can use it to display the contents of any text file you choose.In the while loop of Program 16.2, the character that is returned by the getchar function is assigned to the variable c and is then compared against the defined value EOF. If the values are equal, this means that you have read the final character from the file. One important point must be mentioned with respect to the EOF value that is returned by the getchar function:The function actually returns an int and not a char.This is because the EOF value must be unique; that is, it cannot be equal to the value of any character that would normally be returned by getchar.Therefore, the value returned by getchar is assigned to an int and not a char variable in the preceding program.This works out okay because C allows you to store characters inside ints, even though, in general, it might not be the best of programming practices.If you store the result of the getchar function inside a char variable, the results are unpredictable. On systems that do sign extension of characters, the code might still work okay. On systems that donâ€™t do sign extension, you might end up in an infinite loop.The bottom line is to always remember to store the result of getchar inside an int so that you can properly detect an end-of-file condition.The fact that you can make an assignment inside the conditional expression of the while loop illustrates the flexibility that C provides in the formation of expressions.The parentheses are required around the assignment because the assignment operator has lower precedence than the not equals operator.
